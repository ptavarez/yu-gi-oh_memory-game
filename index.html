        <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism,
          Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of
          the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face
          up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of
          matching cards.</p>
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>Over the course of the game, it becomes known where certain cards are
          located, and so upon turning up one card, players with good memory will
          be able to remember where they have already seen its pair. It is common
          for many players to think they know where pairs are and to turn over
          the one they are sure of first, then be stumped finding its mate. A
          better strategy is to turn over a less certain card first, so that if
          wrong, one knows not to bother turning a more certain card over.</p>
